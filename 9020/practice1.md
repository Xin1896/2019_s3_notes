# Practice Set 1

* How many numbers are there between 100 and 1000 that are:

a) divisible by three:

1. floor(n/k) - floor(m-1/k)
2. floor(1000/3) - floor(99/3)
3. 333 - 33 = 300

b) divisible by five

1. floor(n/k) - floor(m-1/k)
2. floor(1000/5) - floor(99/5)
3. 200 - 19 = 181

c) divisible by fifteen

1. floor(n/k) - floor(m-1/k)
2. floor(1000/15) - floor(99/15)
3. 66 - 6 = 60

* Let Σ = {a,b,c} and Φ = {a,c,e}

a) how many words are in the set Σ^2?
