### What is discrete maths, what is number theory?
* Discrete as in "chunks" - as opposed to Continuous mathematics
* Pertaining to whole numbers
* Number theory - where arithmetic meets discrete mathematics

### Applications of number theory:
* Cryptography - Primes, Divisibility
* Large integer calculations (modular arithmetic)
* Date and time calculations (modular arithmetic) 
	- Modular arithmetic is also known as "clock arithmetic"
* Solving optimization problems (integer linear programming)
