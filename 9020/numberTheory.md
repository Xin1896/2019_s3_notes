# Sets, Sequences and Functions

Specific questions: How many numbers between 1000 and 1000000?
How many numbers between 62345897 and 192408917245097?

General question: How many numbers between m and n?

If we can solve the general question, then we can solve the specific question.

Specific to general cases is called *abstraction*

Example - a general problem:

	How many integers *i* are there with 1 <= *i* <= *n*?

If *n* is a positive integer, there are *n* integers *i* such that 1 <= *i* <= *n*

If *m* and *n* are positive integers with *m*<=*n*, then the number of integers *i* such that m <= *i* <= *n* is:
	*n* - (*m* - 1) = *n* - *m* + *1*
